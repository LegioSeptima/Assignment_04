# R for Data Science
## 10.5 Exercises

### 5. What does tibble::enframe() do? When might you use it?

enframe() converts vectors or lists to a dataframe. The opposite to this is deframe(). I would use enframe() when I am given a vector or list to analyze.

## 12.6 Exercises
### 3. I claimed that iso2 and iso3 were redundant with country. Confirm this claim.

```{R}
head(who)
tail(who)
```

No matter which observation one picks, iso2 and iso3 changes accordingly with country and is redundant.

### 4. For each country, year, and sex compute the total number of cases of TB. Make an informative visualisation of the data.

```{R}
whoTidy <- who %>%
  gather(code, value, new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(code = stringr::str_replace(code, "newrel", "new_rel")) %>%
  separate(code, c("new", "var", "sexage")) %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3) %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1) %>% 
  group_by(country, year, sex) %>% 
  summarize(Number =n())
whoTidy
```
